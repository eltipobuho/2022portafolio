        </div>
        <div class="estudios-two-col">
          <p>The GSS app was developed to make the ordering food process, made of a sandwich, drinks and extras, quick and efficient for working people that follow tight schedulees and have little to no free time.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="temas-explicando">
        <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
        <p>Due to their work schedules and side activities on their free time, users can't take healthy meals during their lunch breaks for them or their families.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="temas-explicando">
        <h3>THE OBJECTIVE</h3>
        <p>Provide users with the option to assemble healthy meals quickly and give them the option to save their choices on a list to speed up the process in the future.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="temas-explicando">
        <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
        <p>The research objective is to find the needs and experiences of users with previous solutions foreign to the proyect, this process was done twice on the initial proposal of the app, through unmoderated interviews, this were the findings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>No time to cook:</b> All users have little to no time to prepare mproper meals at home to take to work, due to their limtied time and side activities.</li>
          <li><b>Lunch sent to their workplace:</b> Most users don't have time to go to restaurants for their meals and require them to be send to their workplace on time.</li>
          <li><b>Difficulty on the use of the app:</b> Some users hace limited tech knowledge and require solutions in a language they can understand.</li>
          <li><b>Personal information:</b> All the users have doubts about giving their personal information to app when all they need is to order food and nothing else.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="temas-explicando">
        <h3>Personas + Process map</h3>
        <p>The results of the interviews helped in the definition of two Personas. For that reason, to understand the situation better, a process map was created that follow users on an average food ordering app.</p>

        <h3>Definition and ideation</h3>
        <p>Through the research done, it was discovered that users need a quick process for ordering food but they need to have control on the ingredients it will have and they need to understand what they are doing, for that reason <b>the solution must provide defined steps, easy to use and they will follow an efficient flow:</b> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>For a large group of users the <b>language</b> is a problem, for that reason the app must have the option to switch languages at will.</li>
          <li>Half the users had doubts about the <b>payment method</b>, so the need of an easier process with assistance in text and video is required.</li>
          <li>Most users asked about the use of their <b>personal information</b>, so it must present legal documentation about it and a limited required info from the users in favor of the functionality of the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>The development of this app let me see a set of steps required to follow in order to achieve an objective that goes beyond the mentality of the designer, the emphaty and desicion-making is focused totally in the user.
        <br>
        The variety on the requirements shows a considerable challenge at the time to bring solutions and listen all of them is a huge assistance for the project and future enterprises, analyze and gather information with like-minded people, in knowledge but different in points of view, is the best experience any team member looking for solutions that improve people's conditions is always something to be grateful.</p>
